1) Modern Data and Computer Languages – This chapter talks about
   the common data structures that modern, object oriented
   programming languages like Perl all are centered around. Namely
   hashes, arrays and scalars. This is important groundwork, because
   YAML is also centered around these structures. The also covers
   types and references which are essential in explaining YAML. The
   chapter talks about YAML’s design goals, like Human Readability.
   Finally the chapter explains the complimentary relationship of
   YAML to XML and JSON.

  A) YAML – A Language for Data 
  B) Data, Data Structures and Databases 
  C) Hashes, Arrays and Scalars 
  D) Modern Programming Languages 
  E) Types and Objects 
  F) Data References 
  G) Human Readability 
  H) YAML, XML and JSON 

2) The YAML Data Format – Like the Camel book for Perl, this chapter
   has the “Gory Details” and is definitely the primary reference
   part of the book. The chapter starts with the basics, but then
   systematically covers all the YAML syntax and semantics in depth.

  A) Simple Collections 
  B) Comments 
  C) Block vs Flow 
  D) Streams and Documents 
  E) Scalars - TMTOWTDI 
  F) Data Types 
  G) YAML Tags and Explicit Typing 
  H) Implicit Typing 
  I) Aliases and Anchors - (References and Recursion) 
  J) Complex Keys 
  K) Sets and Ordered Mappings 
  L) YAML Specification Numbering 

3) Processing YAML - This chapter explains the common ways that computer
   programs consume and produce YAML. Copyright © 2004, O’Reilly
   Media. All rights reserved.

  A) Dump / Load API 
  B) Streaming API 
  C) Data Shadowing 

4) The Full YAML Stack - When transferring data between a YAML
   document and an internal data structure, there is a multilayered
   “stack” of steps that happened in each direction. This chapter
   goes into detail and examination of exactly what happens at each of
   these steps.

  A) Dump Stack 
    A) Dump 
    B) Represent 
    C) Serialize 
    D) Present 
  B) Load Stack 
    A) Parse 
    B) Compose 
    C) Construct 
    D) Load 
  C) Round Tripping 
  D) Type Resolution 

5) YAML Programming Reference - This chapter explains the common tools
   and APIs currently available in 6 different programming languages.

  A) Ruby 
  B) Python 
  C) Perl 
  D) PHP 
  E) Java 
  F) JavaScript 

6) Appendix I - YAML Projects Overview - This appendix discusses the
   major relevant projects driving YAML its community.

  A) Specification - The YAML 1.2 Specification 
  B) libyaml - The definitive C library for processing YAML 
  C) Syck - The original C library 
  D) Ypaste - The YAML Validator 
  E) Rx - Schema Language 

7) Appendix II - YAML in the Wild - This appendix shows the major uses
   of YAML in various high profile projects.

  A) Ruby on Rails - YAML is the configuration language of choice. 
  B) CPAN - Perl module metadata is stored in YAML. 
  C) Catalyst - Uses YAML for configuration. 

8) Index - Standard Index of Terms
