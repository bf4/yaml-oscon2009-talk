2:35pm   Transparent Sharing of Complex Data with YAML   Ingy döt Net
(Hackers, Inc) 



YAML is the only complete data serialization language that works across Perl,
Python, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript and Python. It does so in a way that is truly a
pleasure for people to read.

JSON is adequate for simple objects and arrays, but is not suited for typed
data and recursive references among other things. XML doesn’t have an
information model compatible with the data structures of these languages. For
many applications, using YAML is the clear choice.

Many people use YAML for simple day to day tasks in frameworks like Ruby on
Rails, but YAML was designed from the ground up to deal with deeply complex
data issues. YAML frameworks have matured in the last couple years to be able
to deliver robust data sharing.

In this talk, Ingy döt Net, one of the three inventors of YAML, will show you
in several programming languages:

    * The ins, outs and special secrets of the YAML language
    * Dumping complex data objects and loading them back into memory
    * Parsing and emitting YAML using streaming, event driven APIs
    * Issues in sharing data between programming languages

Ingy döt Net is just another Perl hacker and one of the 3 inventors of the
YAML serialization language. He has over 100 Perl modules on CPAN including a
recent port of Python’s peerless PyYaml framework; an effort supported by The
Perl Foundation.
